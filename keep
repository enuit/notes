When installing https://github.com/kylebebak/notes, this file is copied to
/usr/local/Cellar/notes/<version>

This file ensures homebrew doesn't raise an "Empty installation"
exception during install. Since the only file being installed is named
`notes`, homebrew thinks nothing meaningful was installed and raises
an "Empty installation" exception. This behavior was introduced to homebrew in
commit 915ac06db21acc5c9595b2223cc39b9672f34c4a.

This file has no other function and can be safely removed after install.
I got the idea for using a keep file to avoid the exception from:
